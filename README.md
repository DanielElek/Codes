# This GitHub repository contains my most interesting projects from the start of my studies of Applied Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, so from the last 1.5 years
---
## I categorized my projects into two subfolders, with one more, Natural Language Processing still being in works, as that is the current project I am working on
 * ## Computer vision: this contains projects where I worked with image data
    * Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Center - February 2024: 
        - I developed a pipeline for the Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Center that recognizes the roots of plants, cleans the resulting masks of false positives and measures the main root length of each individual plant with an sMAPE value of 18.963 %. Afterwards, I trained a robot with the help of reinforcement learning to find the end coordinates of the roots and inoculate them.
        - For the CNN that recognizes the roots of the plants, I used the U-net architecture, training it on around 120 images.

    * Soldier Recognition - April 2023:
        - The goal of the model is to differentiate soldiers from civilians, which it manages to do with an accuracy of ~ 82% after training it with around 500 images.
        - I had the task to create a project that can have the potential to be a real life product, therefore I also had to conduct market research, market segmentation, competitor analysis, etc.
        - I developed a custom CNN model that I tuned myself with a trial and error approach.

* ## Structured data analysis: this contains project where I worked with tabular data
    * Spotify Listening (Personal Project) - February 2024:
        - I requested my listening data up to the end of 2023, which I received in different csv files, so I merged, cleaned, explored and visualized it.
        - The data contains my listening habit from 2017 - 2023.
        - It is still in progress.

    * Television company's EDA - February 2023:
        - I worked with multiple millions of rows of data from Banijay Benelux, which I cleaned, merged and visualized then built a machine learning model at the end. I examined the correlation between the rating and the number of viewers and derived future strategies from it.
        - This was my first real data science project.
    
    * Walked or ran from Apple Health (Personal Project) - November 2023:
        - I exported my Apple Health data, which I then cleaned, explored and visualized.
        - The dataset contains information from 2018 - 2023.
